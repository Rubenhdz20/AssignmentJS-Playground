// Ideas for games that can be created in JavaScript and played in the console:

// Hangman - a classic word guessing game where the player tries to guess the hidden word letter by letter before running out of guesses.

// Tic Tac Toe - a two-player game where each player takes turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a row wins.

// Rock Paper Scissors - a two-player game where each player chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

// Blackjack - a card game where the player tries to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21 points.

// Minesweeper - a single-player game where the player tries to clear a grid of hidden mines by flagging them and using logic to deduce their locations.

// Snake - a single-player game where the player controls a growing snake that must avoid walls and obstacles while eating food to grow.

// 2048 - a single-player puzzle game where the player combines tiles with the same number to create a tile with a higher number, trying to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

// Text Adventure - a game where the player navigates through a series of text-based scenarios by making choices that affect the outcome of the story.

// These are just a few examples, but there are many more possibilities depending on your interests and skill level in JavaScript.
